## Advanced Features & Innovation

### 1. **Multi-Layered Emotion Analysis**
Instead of basic emotion labels, Proximo uses:
```json
{
  "emotion": "joy",
  "confidence": 0.65,
  "all_scores": {
    "joy": 0.65,
    "fear": 0.25,
    "surprise": 0.08,
    "love": 0.02
  },
  "secondary_emotions": {"fear": 0.25}
}
```

### 2. **Dynamic System Prompts**
- **Emotion-specific instructions** for tone, approach, language
- **Confidence-based adjustments** (high confidence = direct, low = probe)
- **Generation parameters** tuned per emotion (temperature, top_p)
- **Secondary emotion integration** for nuanced responses

### 3. **Real-Time Communication**
- **WebSocket connections** for instant responses
- **Streaming audio** with base64 encoding
- **Conversation memory** within sessions
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks
